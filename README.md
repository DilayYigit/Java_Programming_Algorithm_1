This respiratory contains the lab works and the solutions of the CS 101 course I took at Bilkent University. This course introduces fundamentals of computer programming: top-down structured design, sequence, decision, repetition, syntax, compilation, debugging and maintenance, object-oriented programming with Java, objects, classes, methods, parameters, arrays, layout and style. The emphasis is on an engineering ''right-first-time'' approach to solving problems using computers.
